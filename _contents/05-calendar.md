Suggested readings included help you understand the course material. They are not required, i.e. you are only responsible for the material covered in lecture. Most of the suggested reading listed are more advanced than the corresponding lecture, and are of interest if you want to know where our knowledge comes from or follow current frontiers of research. Please refer to the [Resource](#Resource) section for the texts.

B = Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (by Bishop)

DL = Deep Learning Book

MK = Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms (by MacKay)

RG = Roger Grosse's Notes
